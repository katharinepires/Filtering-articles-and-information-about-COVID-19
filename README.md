# Filtering Articles and Information About COVID-19
Codes and algorithms for filtering information using keywords. Making searches more practical and faster

The notebooks published here are related to the data and tasks that are available in this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=558) on the Kaggle website:

Inside the Dataset there are tasks to be done and submitted. There are several and there are always updates within them.
The tasks are very cool and require a lot of attention, although they are very important, in this example below shows a little of how the codes and algorithms to be used are requested.

With the limitations of my machine, I was unable to run the entire code and had to use a sample throughout the code. Here you will find several techniques for making filters and using keywords to find the ideal article for what you are looking for. 

I used the following Machine Learning techniques:
* Searching for a word using NTKL
* Searching for a word using FIND
* Searching for more than one word using spsCy
* Similar articles using Fuzzywuzzy
* Similar documents using TD-IDF
* Grouping of documents

Using the grouping technique, it is possible to create a code where you hover your mouse and within that group it will indicate which is the article, showing the title and the abstract

The importance of this type of project is precisely to facilitate research by professionals in the field, so that the search for more information is easier and thus their work as well. The professional will spend less time searching for information, being able to filter by what he really seeks, making his research more practical.

The database size is very large, so I will leave the link for the most compact version I used. The current database on the Kaggle website is more up to date than the data I used for this project, but the aim of this project is to provide learning and also learn, I hope you like the code, this was the biggest code ever I've worked so far.

## UPADTE: Some times the code don't load, so I will get here the link of the code in my Google Colab!!
